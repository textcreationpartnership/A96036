            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For my owne part, I am of the opinion of thoſe, who conceive that the ſtrength of reaſon already ſet downe, in the Preamble to this Bill, by yeſterdayes vote, is a neceſſary deciſion of this Queſtion: For one of the maine ends for which Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſet up, is to advance and further the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reformation and growth of Religion; which wee have already voted, this Government doth contradict; ſo that it is deſtructive to the very end for which it ſhould be, and is moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and deſireable; in which reſpect certainly we have cauſe enough to lay it aſide, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as uſeleſſe, in that it attaines not its end, but as dangerous, in that it deſtroy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In the ſecond place, we have voted it preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to the civill State, as having ſo powerfull and ill an influence upon our Laws, the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the King, and liberties of the Subject, that it is like a ſpreading leproſie, which leaves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing untainted, and uninfected which it comes neere.</p>

                  </gap>r foot of men:</hi> ſo Church-government, in the generall, is good, and that which is neceſſary, and which we all deſire; but when any particular forme of it hath once loſt its ſavour, by being deſtructive to its owne ends, for which it is ſet up, (as by our vote already paſſed we ſay this hath) then ſurely, Sir, we have no more to doe but to caſt it out, and endevour, the beſt we can, to provide ourſelves a better.</p>
            <p>But to this it hath beene ſaid that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment now in queſtion, may be for amended and reformed, that it needs not be pulled quite downe or aboliſhed: becauſe it is conceived, it hath no originall ſinne, or evill in it: or if it have, it is ſaid, regeneration will take that way.</p>
            <p>Vnto which I anſwer, I doe conſent that we ſhould do with this Government, as we are done by in regeneration, in which all old things are to paſſe away, and all things are to become new, and this we muſt doe, if we deſire a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and growth of our Religion, or good to our civill ſtate. For the whole Fabrick of this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111440:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 106 -->building is ſo rotten and corrupt, from the very foundation of it to the top, that if we pull it not down now, it will fall about the eares of all thoſe that endevour it, within a very few yeares.</p>
            <p>The univerſall rottenneſſe, or corruption of this government, will moſt evidently appeare by a diſquiſition into theſe enſuing particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Let us conſider in what ſoile this root growes: Is it not in the Popes Paradiſe? doe not one and the ſame principles and grounds main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Papacie, or univerſall Biſhop, as doe our Dioceſan or Metropolitan Biſhops? All thoſe authorities which have beene brought us out of the Fathers and antiquity, will they not as well, if not better, ſupport the Popedome as the order of our Biſhops? So likewiſe all theſe arguments for its agreeableneſſe to Monarchy, and cure of Schiſme, doe they not much more ſtrongly hold for the acknowledgement of the Pope, then for our Biſhops? and yet have Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies beene ever a whit the more abſolute for the Popes univerſall Monarchy? or their Kingdomes leſſe ſubject to ſchiſmes and ſeditions? whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other kingdomes have beene, I am ſure our Hiſtories can tell us, this Kingdome hath not: and therefore we have caſt him off long ſince, as hee is forraine, though we have not beene without one in our owne bowels. For the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a Metropolitan, or Dioceſan, or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Biſhop, is not of kinds, but of degrees: and a Metropolitan or Dioceſan Biſhop is as ill
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111440:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 106 -->able to performe the duty of a Paſtor to his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe or Province, as the Vniverſall Biſhop is able to doe it to the whole world: For the one cannot doe but by Deputies, and no more can the other; and therefore ſince we all confeſſe the grounds upon which the Papacy ſtands are rotten, how can we deny but theſe that maintain our Biſhops are ſo too, ſince they are one and the ſame?</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, let us conſider by what hand this root of Epiſcopacy was planted, and how it came into the Church.</p>
            <p>It is no difficult matter to finde this out; for is not the very ſpirit of this order, a ſpirit of pride, exalting it ſelfe in the Temple of God, over all that is called God? Firſt, exalting it ſelfe above its fellow Presbiters, under the forme of a Biſhop; then over its fellow Biſhops, under the title of Archbiſhops, and ſo ſtill mounting over thoſe of its own profeſſion, till it come to be Pope, and then it ſticks not to tread upon the necks of Princes, Kings, and Emperours, and trample them under its feet. Alſo thus you may trace it from it firſt riſe, and diſcerne by what ſpirit this order came into the Church, and by what doore; even by the back-doore of pride and ambition, not by Chriſt Jeſus. It is not a plant which Gods right hand hath planted, but is full of rottenneſſe and corruption; that myſtery of iniquity, which hath wrought thus long, and ſo fit to be plucked up, and removed out of the way.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:111440:5"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 107 -->
            <p>Thirdly, Let us conſider the very nature and quality of this tree, or root in its ſelfe, whether it be good or corrupt in its owne nature; we all know where it is ſaid, <hi>A good tree cannot bring forth corrupt fruit, nor a corrupt tree good fruit: Doe men gather grapes of thornes, or ſigs of thiſtles?</hi> By its fruit therefore we ſhall be ſure to know it; and according as the fruits of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have beene amongſt us, either in Church, of Common-wealth, ſo let it ſtand, or fall with us.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>In the Church.</head>
               <p>AS it ſelfe came in by the back doore into the Church, and was brought in by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Antichriſt, ſo it ſelfe hath been the back-doore and in-let of all ſuperſtition and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the worſhip and doctrine of this Church, and the meanes of haſtening us back againe to Rome. For proofe of this, I appeale to all our knowledges in late yeares paſt, the memory whereof is ſo freſh, I need enter into no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>A ſecond fruit of this Government in the Church, hath beene the diſplacing of the moſt godly and Conſcientious Miniſters; the vexing, puniſhing, and baniſhing out of the Kingdome, the moſt religious of all ſorts and conditions, that would not comply with their ſuperſtitious inventions and ceremonies; in one word, the turning the edge and power of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

                  </gap> would uphold their party. Thouſands of examples might be given of this, if it were not moſt notorious.</p>
               <p>A third fruit hath been Sciſme and Fractions within our ſelves, and Alienation from all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches abroad.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, the prodigious monſter of the late Canons, whereby they had deſigned the whole Nation to a perpetuall ſlavery and bondage to themſelves, and their ſuperſtitious Inventions. Theſe are the fruits of the Government in the Church. Now let us conſider theſe in the Civil State: As:</p>

                  <item>1 The countenancing all illegall Projects and proceedings, by teaching in their pulpits the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of an arbitrary Power.</item>

               <p>If then the tree bee to be knowne by its fruits, I hope you ſee by this time plainly the nature and quality of this tree.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, give mee leave for a cloſe of all to preſent to your conſideration the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheifes, which the continuance of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth threaten us with, if by the wiſdome of this Committee they be not prevented.</p>
